# Sample Page

## MathJax Test

$$
  \frac{\pi}{2} =
  \left( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{\sqrt{x}} dx \right)^2 =
  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(2k)!}{2^{2k}(k!)^2} \frac{1}{2k+1} =
  \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4k^2}{4k^2 - 1}
$$

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://fumiyan.work/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fumiyanll23/MyWeblog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
